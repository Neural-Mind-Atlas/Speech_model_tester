The heterodyne interferometry system utilizes a frequency-stabilized helium-neon laser operating at six hundred thirty-two-point-eight nanometers, coupled with acousto-optic modulators generating eighty-megahertz carrier frequencies for phase-locked loop demodulation. The measurement apparatus incorporates polarization-maintaining single-mode optical fibers with numerical apertures of zero-point-one-two and core diameters of eight-point-two micrometers, achieving displacement resolution of approximately fifty picometers over measurement ranges exceeding one hundred millimeters. Signal processing algorithms employ fast Fourier transform techniques with Hamming window functions and zero-padding interpolation to extract phase information from quadrature-encoded photodetector outputs. The environmental isolation system maintains temperature stability within plus-or-minus ten millikelvin using proportional-integral-derivative controllers and vibration isolation through pneumatic damping systems with resonant frequencies below one hertz. Calibration procedures involve traceability to national metrology institutes using certified reference materials and precision gauge blocks manufactured according to ASME-B89-standard specifications.
