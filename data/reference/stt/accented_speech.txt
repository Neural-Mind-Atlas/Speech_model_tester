The prestigious Rajasthan Institute of Technology's nanotechnology research programme has developed revolutionary semiconductor fabrication techniques utilising gallium arsenide substrates with indium gallium phosphide quantum wells. Professor Shrinivas Venkataraman, originally from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, collaborated with colleagues from the University of Edinburgh to investigate the optoelectronic properties of these heterostructures. The interdisciplinary team's findings, published in the Journal of Applied Physics, demonstrated extraordinary electron mobility values exceeding two hundred thousand square centimetres per volt-second at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Furthermore, the photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements revealed unprecedented quantum efficiency characteristics, particularly at telecommunication wavelengths around fifteen hundred nanometres. The manufacturing process, involving molecular beam epitaxy and metal-organic chemical vapour deposition, required stringent environmental controls with particulate contamination levels below ten particles per cubic metre and temperature stability within plus-or-minus zero-point-one degrees Celsius.
