Uh, the, um, the acoustic signal processing algorithm—sorry, there's some background noise here—the algorithm demonstrated, uh, significant improvements in, in speech enhancement capabilities when, when tested under, um, adverse auditory conditions. The, uh, the spectral subtraction method, combined with, with Wiener filtering techniques, achieved a signal-to-noise ratio improvement of approximately, um, let me see, approximately fifteen-point-two decibels. However, uh, the computational complexity, the computational complexity remained, um, remained challenging, particularly for, for real-time applications requiring, uh, requiring latencies below fifty milliseconds. The, the research team, led by, um, Dr. Yamamoto from, from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, implemented, uh, implemented a novel deep neural network architecture that, that incorporated, um, attention mechanisms and, and long short-term memory units to, to address these, these performance bottlenecks.
