Despite the manufacturer's claims that their latest text-to-speech system could handle multi-syllabic pharmaceutical nomenclature with 99.7% accuracy; the independent evaluation revealed significant degradation when processing concatenated technical specifications, particularly those containing parenthetical citations (e.g., Johnson et al., 2023), em-dashes—which often interrupt natural speech flow—and complex numerical sequences like IPv6 addresses (2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334), thereby necessitating comprehensive re-calibration of the underlying acoustic models.
